Signing HTTP Messages Contribution Guide
========================================

This specification is under active development, and the more participants
we get the better for everyone. We want this specification to be a
useful addition to the ecosystem of the Internet, so it needs to be
readable, useful and effective.

You can contribute to the project by looking at the
[open issues](https://github.com/w3c-dvcg/http-signatures/issues) and join
a discussion, or raise a new issue if you have a bug or new feature
suggestion.

First though, take a look at the guiding principles of the project:

# Principles

## Platform, Language & Transport neutrality

This protocol is meant to provide a technical mechanism to produce and
verify the origin and integrity of HTTP Messages in a platform-agnostic way

- The protocol should not be overly specific with a particular
  implementation, language, runtime or framework.
  The protocol should work the same way for all.

- The protocol must be independent of the transport and any security
  mechanisms implemented there e.g. client & server TLS certificates.

- While the protocol only protects headers, payload integrity can be assured
  through inrorporation of other mechanisms such as Digest header. The
  protocol should not be overly prescriptive of specific techniques but
  illustrate how implementations might use them to achieve these goals.

## Simple and Compatible

- This specification should comply fully with the state of HTTP except where
compliance would introduce security concerns.

  - If HTTP does or permits something, this protocol should allow it to be
  signed.

  - This means we also support things that present for legacy reasons or
    perhaps don't seem like an obviously good idea, unless there is a good
    (especially security) reason not to.

- Any implementation that does not recognise or support this protocol should
  be able to ignore any signature header safely.

- The specification should avoid wherever possible any aspects requiring
  negotiation or agreement between parties. Out-of-band specification of
  permissible parameters, keys etc should be relied upon unless critical to
  security or functionality.

- This specification must not apply new interpretations to existing
  concepts and terms

- This specification should be simple enough for non-specialists to
  understand and recognise the core concepts, allowing them to make informed
  choices on how it can/should be used, while also specific enough that
  implementers can unambiguously understand how to produce and verify a
  signature safely and effectively.

# What You See is What You Sign

- Signatures serve an immediate purpose to authenticate and verify a
  HTTP message as it is processed by intermediaries and eventually received
  by the target system (client or server), so the protocol
  should provide a mechanism to determine the timeliness of a signature

- Signatures may serve an after-the-fact purpose to be able to verify that a
  request or response was properly verified at some point in the past
  (auditing)

- To serve both the above purposes, signatures should be verifiable given
  the information available at that time. Signatures should not rely on
  information not present in a given message except for the secrets used.
