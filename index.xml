  <t>
When communicating over the Internet using the HTTP protocol, it can be
desirable for a server or client to authenticate the sender of a
particular message. It can also be desirable to ensure that the message 
was not tampered with during transit. This document describes a way for 
servers and clients to simultaneously add authentication and 
message integrity to HTTP messages by using a digital signature.

 <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>
This protocol extension is intended to provide a simple and standard way for 
clients to sign HTTP messages.
  </t>
  
  <t>
<xref target="RFC2617">HTTP Authentication</xref> defines Basic and Digest 
authentication mechanisms, <xref target="RFC5246">TLS 1.2</xref>
defines cryptographically strong transport layer security, and 
<xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> provides a 
fully-specified alternative for authorization of web service requests. Each of
these approaches are employed on the Internet today with varying degrees of 
protection. However, none of these schemes are designed to cryptographically 
sign the HTTP messages themselves.
  </t>

  <t>
Several web service providers have invented their own schemes for signing
HTTP messages, but to date, none have been standardized. While there
are no techniques in this proposal that are novel beyond the previous art, it
is useful to standardize a simple and cryptographically strong mechanism for 
digitally signing HTTP messages.
  </t> 

  <section anchor="intro-requests" title="Using Signatures in HTTP Requests">
   <t>
It is common practice to protect sensitive website API functionality via 
authentication mechanisms. Often, the entity accessing these APIs is a
piece of automated software outside of an interactive human session. While
there are mechanisms like OAuth and API secrets that are used to grant
API access, each have their weaknesses such as unnecessary complexity 
for particular use cases or the use of shared secrets which may not be 
acceptable to an implementer.
   </t>
   <t>
Digital signatures are widely used to provide authentication without 
the need for shared secrets. They also do not require a round-trip in
order to authenticate the client. A server need only have a mapping between
the key being used to sign the content and the authorized entity to
verify that a message was signed by that entity.
   </t>
   <t>
This specification provides two mechanisms that can be used by a server
to authenticate a client. The first is the 'Signature' HTTP Authentication
Scheme, which may be used for interactive sessions. The second is the 
Signature HTTP Header, which is typically used by automated software
agents.
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="intro-responses" title="Using Signatures in HTTP Responses">
   <t>
For high security transactions, having an additional signature on the HTTP 
header allows a client to ensure that even if the transport channel has been 
compromised, that the content of the messages have not been compromised.
This specification provides a HTTP Signature Header mechanism that can be 
used by a client to authenticate the sender of a message and ensure that
particular headers have not been modified in transit.
   </t>
  </section>
 
 </section>
 
 <section anchor="components" title="The Components of a Signature">
  <t>
There are a number of components in a signature that are common between the
'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme and the 'Signature' HTTP Header. This
section details the components of a digital signature.
  </t>

   <section anchor="params" title="Signature Parameters">

    <t>
The following section details the signature parameters.
    </t>

    <section anchor="keyId" title="keyId">
     <t>
REQUIRED.  The `keyId` field is an opaque string that the server can use to look
up the component they need to validate the signature.  It could be an SSH key
fingerprint, a URL to machine-readable key data, an LDAP DN, etc.  Management 
of keys and assignment of `keyId` is out of scope for this document.
     </t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="algorithm" title="algorithm">

     <t>
REQUIRED. The `algorithm` parameter is used to specify the digital signature
algorithm to use when generating the signature. Valid values for this
parameter can be found in the Signature Algorithms registry located at 
<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/signature-algorithms">
http://www.iana.org/assignments/signature-algorithms</eref> and MUST NOT be
marked "deprecated".
     </t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="headers" title="headers">

     <t>
OPTIONAL.  The `headers` parameter is used to specify the list of HTTP headers
included when generating the signature for the message.  If specified, it 
should be a lowercased, quoted list of HTTP header fields, separated by a 
single space character. If not specified, implementations MUST operate as if 
the field were specified with a single value, the `Date` header, in the list 
of HTTP headers. Note that the list order is important, and MUST be specified in 
the order the HTTP header field-value pairs are concatenated together 
during signing.
     </t>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="signature" title="signature">
     <t>
REQUIRED.  The `signature` parameter is a base 64 encoded digital signature,
as described in <xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>, 
<eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4">Section 4</eref>.
The client uses the `algorithm` and `headers` signature parameters to form a 
canonicalized `signing string`.  This `signing string` is then signed with the 
key associated with `keyId` and the algorithm corresponding to `algorithm`.
The `signature` parameter is then set to the base 64 encoding of the signature.
     </t>
    </section>
   </section>

   <section anchor="ambiguity" title="Ambiguous Parameters">
    <t>
If any of the parameters listed above are erroneously duplicated in the 
associated header field, then the last parameter defined MUST be used. Any
parameter that is not recognized as a parameter, or is not well-formed, 
MUST be ignored.
    </t>
   </section>
   
   <section anchor="canonicalization" title="Signature String Construction">
   
   <t>
In order to generate the string that is signed with a key, the client MUST use
the values of each HTTP header field in the `headers` Signature parameter, 
in the order they appear in the `headers` Signature parameter. It is out of 
scope for this document to dictate what header fields 
an application will want to enforce, but implementers SHOULD at minimum 
include the request target and Date header fields.
   </t>
   <t>
To include the HTTP request target in the signature calculation, use the 
special `(request-target)` header field name.
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
If the header field name is `(request-target)` then generate the header field 
value by concatenating the lowercased :method, an ASCII space, the 
:authority, an ASCII space, and the :path pseudo-headers (as specified in
<eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-13#section-8.1.2.1">HTTP/2, Section 8.1.2.1</eref>).
     </t>
     <t>
Create the header field string by concatenating the lowercased header field 
name followed with an ASCII colon `:`, an ASCII space ` `, and the header 
field value. Leading and trailing optional whitespace (OWS) in the header field 
value MUST be omitted (as specified in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging">HTTPbis 1.1, Part 1</xref>, 
<eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-26#section-3.2.4">Section 3.2.4</eref>). 
Any other modification to the header field value MUST NOT be made. If there are 
multiple instances of the same header field, all header field values associated 
with the header field MUST be concatenated and used in the order in which 
they will appear in the transmitted HTTP message.
     </t>
     <t>
If value is not the last value then append an ASCII newline `\n`.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>   
  </section>
  
  <section anchor="create" title="Creating a Signature">

   <t>
In order to create a signature, a client MUST:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
Use the contents of the HTTP message, the `headers` value, and the 
Signature String Construction algorithm to create the signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
The `algorithm` and key associated with `keyId` must then be used to
generate a digital signature on the signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
The `signature` is then generated by base 64 encoding the output of the
digital signature algorithm.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
For example, assume that the `algorithm` value was "rsa-sha256". This would
signal to the application that the data associated with `keyId` is an
RSA Private Key (as defined in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>), the
signature string hashing function is SHA-256, and the signing
algorithm is the one defined in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>, 
Section <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.2.1">
Section 8.2.1</eref>. The result of the signature creation algorithm 
specified in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref> should result in a
binary string, which is then base 64 encoded and placed into the
`signature` value.
   </t>
  
  </section>  
  
  <section anchor="verify" title="Verifying a Signature">

   <t>
In order to verify a signature, a server MUST:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
Use the received HTTP message, the `headers` value, and the Signature String 
Construction algorithm to recreate the signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
The `algorithm`, `keyId`, and base 64 decoded `signature` listed in the 
signature parameters are then used to verify the authenticity of the 
digital signature.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
For example, assume that the `algorithm` value was "rsa-sha256". This would
signal to the application that the data associated with `keyId` is an
RSA Public Key (as defined in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>), the
signature string hashing function is SHA-256, and the `signature` 
verification algorithm to use to verify the signature is the one defined in
<xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>, Section <eref 
target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.2.2">
Section 8.2.2</eref>. The result of the signature verification algorithm 
specified in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref> should result in a
successful verification unless the headers protected by the signature were
tampered with in transit.
   </t>
  
  </section>  
 </section>
  
 <section anchor="auth-scheme" title="The 'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme">

  <t>
The "signature" authentication scheme is based on the model that the client must
authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by either a private
asymmetric key (e.g., RSA) or a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC).  The scheme
is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or
signing algorithm.  However, it does explicitly assume that clients can send an
HTTP `Date` header.
  </t>
  
  <section anchor="auth-header" title="Authorization Header">

   <t>
The client is expected to send an Authorization header 
(as defined in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth">HTTPbis 1.1, Part 7</xref>, <eref 
target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p7-auth-25#section-4.1">
Section 4.1</eref>) where the "auth-scheme" is "Signature" and the 
"auth-param" parameters meet the requirements listed in 
Section 2: The Components of a Signature.
   </t>

   <t>
The rest if this section uses the following HTTP request as an example.

    <figure>
     <artwork>
POST /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
Content-Length: 18

{"hello": "world"}
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
   
   <t>
Note that the use of the `Digest` header field is per 
<xref target="RFC3230">RFC 3230</xref>, <eref 
target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</eref>
and is included merely as a demonstration of how an implementer could include 
information about the body of the message in the signature.
The following sections also assume that the "rsa-key-1" keyId refers to a 
private key known to the client and a public key known to the server. 
The "hmac-key-1" keyId refers to key known to the client and server.
   </t>

   <section anchor="auth-isa" title="Initiating Signature Authorization">

    <t>
A server may notify a client when a protected resource could be accessed by
authenticating itself to the server. To initiate this process, the server
will request that the client authenticate itself via a 401 response code.
For example:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Thu, 08 Jun 2014 18:32:30 GMT
Content-Length: 1234

...

    </figure>
    </t>
   </section>
   
   <section anchor="auth-rsa-example" title="RSA Example">
   
   <t>
The authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>

headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
   
   <t>
The client would compose the signing string as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
host: example.org\n
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n
content-length: 18</artwork>
    </figure>
Note that the '\n' symbols above are included to demonstrate where the new 
line character should be inserted. There is no new line on the final line of
the signing string.
   </t>

   <t>
For an RSA-based signature, the authorization header and signature would then
be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
  </section>
  
  <section anchor="auth-hmac-example" title="HMAC Example">

   <t>
For an HMAC-based signature without a list of headers specified, the 
authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="hmac-key-1",algorithm="hmac-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(HMAC-SHA256(signing string))"
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The only difference between the RSA Example and the HMAC Example is the
signature algorithm that is used. The client would compose the signing string 
in the same way as the RSA Example above:

The minimum recommended data to sign is the (request-target), host, and date. In
this case, the string to sign would be:

A strong signature including all of the headers and a digest of the body of
the HTTP request would result in the following signing string:

Editor's note: The references in this section are problematic as many of the 
specifications that they refer to are too implementation specific, rather 
than just pointing to the proper signature and hashing specifications. A
better approach might be just specifying the signature and hashing function
specifications, leaving implementers to connect the dots (which are not that
hard to connect).
