When communicating over the Internet using the HTTP protocol, it can be
desirable for a server or client to authenticate the sender of a
particular message. It can also be desirable to ensure that the message
was not tampered with during transit. This document describes a way for
servers and clients to simultaneously add authentication and
message integrity to HTTP messages by using a digital signature.

 <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>
This protocol extension is intended to provide a simple and standard way for
clients to sign HTTP messages.
  </t>

  <t>
<xref target="RFC2617">HTTP Authentication</xref> defines Basic and Digest
authentication mechanisms, <xref target="RFC5246">TLS 1.2</xref>
defines cryptographically strong transport layer security, and
<xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> provides a
fully-specified alternative for authorization of web service requests. Each of
these approaches are employed on the Internet today with varying degrees of
protection. However, none of these schemes are designed to cryptographically
sign the HTTP messages themselves, which is required in order to ensure
end-to-end message integrity. An added benefit of signing the HTTP message
for the purposes of end-to-end message integrity is that the client can be
authenticated using the same mechanism without the need for multiple
round-trips.
  </t>

  <t>
Several web service providers have invented their own schemes for signing
HTTP messages, but to date, none have been standardized. While there
are no techniques in this proposal that are novel beyond the previous art, it
is useful to standardize a simple and cryptographically strong mechanism for
digitally signing HTTP messages.
  </t>
  <t>
This specification presents two mechanisms with distinct purposes:
    <list style="numbers">
       <t>
The "Signature" scheme which is intended primarily to allow a sender
to assert the contents of the message sent are correct and have not been
altered during transmission or storage in a way that alters the meaning expressed
in the original message as signed. Any party reading the message (the verifier)
may independently confirm the validity of the message signature. This scheme
is agnostic to the client/server direction and can be used to verify the contents of
either HTTP requests, HTTP reponses, or both.
       </t>
       <t>
The "Authorization" scheme which is intended primarily to allow a sender
to request access to a resource or resources by proving their identity. This
specification allows for this both with a shared secret (using HMAC) or with
public/private keys. The "Authorization" scheme is
typically used in authentication processes and not directly for message signing.
As a consequence `Authorization` header is normally generated
(and the message signed) by the HTTP client and the message verified by
the HTTP server.
       </t>
     </list>
  </t>

  <section anchor="intro-requests" title="Using Signatures in HTTP Requests">
   <t>
It is common practice to protect sensitive website and API functionality via
authentication mechanisms. Often, the entity accessing these APIs is a
piece of automated software outside of an interactive human session. While
there are mechanisms like OAuth and API secrets that are used to grant
API access, each have their weaknesses such as unnecessary complexity
for particular use cases or the use of shared secrets which may not be
acceptable to an implementer. Shared secrets also prohibit any possibility
for non-repudiation, while secure transports such as TLS do not provide
for this at all.
   </t>
   <t>
Digital signatures are widely used to provide authentication and integrity
assurances without
the need for shared secrets. They also do not require a round-trip in
order to authenticate the client, and allow the integrity of a message to
be verified independently of the transport (e.g. TLS).
A server need only have an understanding of the key (e.g. through
a mapping between
the key being used to sign the content and the authorized entity) to
verify that a message was signed by that entity.
   </t>
   <t>
When optionally combined with asymmetric keys in certificates issued
via PKI, this specification can also enable authentication of a client and
server with no prior knowledge of each other via a trusted CA issuing their
respective certificates.
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="intro-responses" title="Using Signatures in HTTP Responses">
   <t>
For high security transactions, having a mechanism to sign HTTP responses
allows a client to ensure that even if the transport channel has been
compromised or intermediates alter the message by adding, removing or
altering headers (even for benign operational reasons) that the content and meaning
of the message has not been compromised.
This specification provides a HTTP Signature Header mechanism that can be
used by a client to authenticate the sender of a message and ensure that
particular headers have not been modified in transit.
   </t>
  </section>

 </section>

 <section anchor="components" title="The Components of a Signature">
  <t>
There are a number of components in a signature that are common between the
'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme and the 'Signature' HTTP Header. This
section details the components of the digital signature paremeters common to
both schemes.
  </t>

   <section anchor="params" title="Signature Parameters">

    <t>
The following section details the signature parameters.
    </t>

    <section anchor="keyId" title="keyId">
     <t>
REQUIRED.  The `keyId` field is an opaque string that the server can use to look
up the component they need to validate the signature.  It could be an SSH key
fingerprint, a URL to machine-readable key data, an LDAP DN, etc.  Management
of keys and assignment of `keyId` is out of scope for this document.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="signature" title="signature">
     <t>
REQUIRED.  The `signature` parameter is a base 64 encoded digital signature,
as described in <xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>,
<eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4">Section 4</eref>.
The client uses the `algorithm` and `headers` signature parameters to form a
canonicalized `signing string`.  This `signing string` is then signed with the
key associated with `keyId` and the algorithm corresponding to `algorithm`.
The `signature` parameter is then set to the base 64 encoding of the signature.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="headers" title="headers">

     <t>
OPTIONAL.  The `headers` parameter is used to specify the list of HTTP headers
included when generating the signature for the message.  If specified, it
SHOULD be a lowercased, quoted list of HTTP header fields, separated by a
single space character. If not specified, implementations MUST operate as if
the field were specified with a single value, `date`, in the list
of HTTP headers. Note:
        <list style="numbers">
           <t>The list order is important, and MUST be specified in
the order the HTTP header field-value pairs are concatenated together
during <xref target="canonicalization">Signature String Construction</xref>
used during signing and verifying.
           </t>
           <t>
A `headers` parameter value without any headers MAY be provided,
but since it results in a signature of an empty string it is of almost no
utility and SHOULD NOT be used. This is distinct from not specifying
a `headers` parameter at all.
           </t>
        </list>
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="algorithm" title="algorithm">

     <t>
OPTIONAL. The `algorithm` parameter is used to specify the digital signature
algorithm to use when generating the signature. Valid values for this
parameter can be found in the
<eref target="#sa-registry">Signature Algorithms Registry</eref> and MUST NOT be
marked "deprecated". It is preferred that the algorithm used by an
implementation be derived from the key metadata identified by the `keyId`
rather than from this field. If `algorithm` is provided and differs from
the key metadata identified by the `keyId` then an implementation
MUST produce an error. The `algorithm` parameter, which may be specified by
an attacker, has the potential to create security vulnerabilities and
will most likely be deprecated in the future.
     </t>
    </section>

   </section>

   <section anchor="ambiguity" title="Ambiguous Parameters">
    <t>
If any of the parameters listed above are erroneously duplicated in the
associated header field, then the last parameter defined MUST be used. Any
parameter that is not recognized as a parameter, or is not well-formed,
MUST be ignored.
    </t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="canonicalization" title="Signature String Construction">

   <t>
A signed HTTP message needs to be tolerant of some
alterations during transmission
as it goes through gateways, proxies, and other entities. As such, the raw
HTTP message transmitted by the signer, and the HTTP message received
by the verifier may have undergone some changes, typically in the form of
added, removed or altered headers. These changes are not normally under the
control of the sender, and often the verifier. While these changes should not
alter the meaning expressed by the sender this protocol allows for any sensitive
or meaningful content changes to be detected by the verifier.
   </t>
   <t>
As such, the signer cannot control which headers may appear in the message
when it arrives at the verifier, and will explicitly indicate which headers were
included in the signature via the `headers` signature parameter. The value of
this parameter is used to construct the intermediate Signature String, which
is the data that is actually signed.
   </t>
   <t>
In order to generate the string that is signed with a key, the client MUST use
the values of each HTTP header field in the `headers` Signature parameter,
in the order they appear in the `headers` Signature parameter. It is out of
scope for this document to dictate what header fields
an application will want to enforce, but implementers SHOULD at minimum
include the request target and Date header fields.
   </t>
   <t>
To include the HTTP request target in the signature calculation, use the
special `(request-target)` header field name.
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
If the header field name is `(request-target)` then generate the header field
value by concatenating the lowercased :method, an ASCII space, and
the :path pseudo-headers (as specified in
<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3">HTTP/2, Section 8.1.2.3</eref>).
Note: For the avoidance of doubt, lowercasing only applies to the :method
pseudo-header and not to the :path pseudo-header.
     </t>
     <t>
Create the header field string by concatenating the lowercased header field
name followed with an ASCII colon `:`, an ASCII space ` `, and the header
field value. Leading and trailing optional whitespace (OWS) in the header field
value MUST be omitted (as specified in
<xref target="RFC7230">RFC7230</xref>,
<eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.4">Section 3.2.4</eref>).
       <list style="numbers">
         <t>
If there are multiple instances of the same header field, all header field
values associated with the header field MUST be concatenated, separated by a
ASCII comma and an ASCII space `, `, and used in the order in which
they will appear in the transmitted HTTP message.
         </t>
         <t>
If the header value (after removing leading and trailing whitepspace)
is a zero-length string, the signature string line correlating with that header
will simply be the (lowercased) header name, an ASCII colon `:`,
and an ASCII space ` `.
         </t>
         <t>
Any other modification to
the header field value MUST NOT be made.
         </t>
         <t>
If a header specified in the headers parameter is malformed or cannot be matched
with a provided header in the message, the signer MUST NOT produce a signature.
         </t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>
If value is not the last value then append an ASCII newline `\n`.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
To illustrate the rules specified above, assume a `headers` parameter list
with the value of
`(request-target) host date cache-control x-emptyheader x-example` with
the following HTTP request headers:

    <figure>
     <artwork>
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
X-Example: Example header
    with some whitespace.
X-EmptyHeader:
Cache-Control: max-age=60
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
For the HTTP request headers above, the corresponding signature string is:

    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): get /foo
host: example.org
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
cache-control: max-age=60, must-revalidate
x-emptyheader: 
x-example: Example header with some whitespace.
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="create" title="Creating a Signature">

   <t>
In order to create a signature, a client MUST:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
Use the contents of the HTTP message, the `headers` value, and the
Signature String Construction algorithm to create the signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
The `algorithm` and key associated with `keyId` must then be used to
generate a digital signature on the signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
The `signature` is then generated by base 64 encoding the output of the
digital signature algorithm.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
For example, assume that the `algorithm` value was "rsa-sha256". This would
signal to the application that the data associated with `keyId` is an
RSA Private Key (as defined in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>), the
signature string hashing function is SHA-256, and the signing
algorithm is the one defined in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>,
Section <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.2.1">
Section 8.2.1</eref>. The result of the signature creation algorithm
specified in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref> should result in a
binary string, which is then base 64 encoded and placed into the
`signature` value.
   </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="verify" title="Verifying a Signature">

   <t>
In order to verify a signature, a server MUST:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
Use the received HTTP message, the `headers` value, and the
<xref target="canonicalization">Signature String Construction</xref>
algorithm to recreate the signature.
     </t>
     <t>
The `algorithm`, `keyId`, and base 64 decoded `signature` listed in the
signature parameters are then used to verify the authenticity of the
digital signature. Note: The application verifying the signature MUST derive
the `algorithm` from the metadata associated with the `keyId` and MUST NOT
use the value of `algorithm` from the signed message.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>
   <t>
If a header specified in the `headers` value of the signature parameters
(or the default item `Date` where the `headers` value is not supplied)
is absent from the message, the message MUST NOT be considered valid.
   </t>

   <t>
For example, assume that the `algorithm` value was "rsa-sha256". This would
signal to the application that the metadata associated with `keyId` will
express a RSA Public Key (as defined in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>),
the signature string hashing function of SHA-256, and the `signature`
verification algorithm to use to verify the signature is the one defined in
<xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref>, Section <eref
target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.2.2">
Section 8.2.2</eref>. The result of the signature verification algorithm
specified in <xref target="RFC3447">RFC 3447</xref> should result in a
successful verification unless the headers protected by the signature were
tampered with in transit.
   </t>

  </section>
 </section>

 <section anchor="auth-scheme" title="The 'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme">

  <t>
The "Signature" authentication scheme is based on the model that the client must
authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by either a private
asymmetric key (e.g., RSA) or a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC).
  </t>
  <t>
The scheme
is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or
signing algorithm.  However, it does explicitly assume that clients can send an
HTTP `Date` header.
  </t>

  <section anchor="auth-header" title="Authorization Header">

   <t>
The client is expected to send an Authorization header
(as defined in
<xref target="RFC7235">RFC 7235</xref>, <eref
target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rfc7235-auth-25#section-4.1">
Section 4.1</eref>) where the "auth-scheme" is "Signature" and the
"auth-param" parameters meet the requirements listed in
Section 2: The Components of a Signature.
   </t>

   <t>
The rest of this section uses the following HTTP request as an example.

    <figure>
     <artwork>
POST /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
Content-Length: 18

{"hello": "world"}
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
Note that the use of the `Digest` header field is per
<xref target="RFC3230">RFC 3230</xref>, <eref
target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</eref>
and is included merely as a demonstration of how an implementer could include
information about the body of the message in the signature.
The following sections also assume that the "rsa-key-1" keyId asserted by the
client is an identifier meaningful to the server.
   </t>

   <section anchor="auth-isa" title="Initiating Signature Authorization">

    <t>
A server may notify a client when a resource is protected by requiring a signature,
To initiate this process, the server
will request that the client authenticate itself via a
<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1">401 response
</eref> code. The
server may optionally specify which HTTP headers it expects to be signed
by specifying the `headers` parameter in the WWW-Authenticate header.
For example:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Thu, 08 Jun 2014 18:32:30 GMT
Content-Length: 1234
Content-Type: text/html
WWW-Authenticate: Signature realm="Example",headers="(request-target) date"

...
</artwork>
    </figure>
    </t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="auth-rsa-example" title="RSA Example">

   <t>
The authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The client would compose the signing string as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
host: example.org\n
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n
content-length: 18</artwork>
    </figure>
Note that the '\n' symbols above are included to demonstrate where the new
line character should be inserted. There is no new line on the final line of
the signing string.
   </t>

   <t>
For an RSA-based signature, the authorization header and signature would then
be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="auth-hmac-example" title="HMAC Example">

   <t>
For an HMAC-based signature without a list of headers specified, the
authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="hmac-key-1",algorithm="hmac-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(HMAC-SHA256(signing string))"
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The only difference between the RSA Example and the HMAC Example is the
signature algorithm that is used. The client would compose the signing string
in the same way as the RSA Example above:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
host: example.org\n
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n
content-length: 18

    </figure>
   </t>

  </section>

 <section anchor="sig" title="The 'Signature' HTTP Header">

  <t>
The "Signature" HTTP Header allows the the sender to add a signature
to a HTTP message (client request or server response) using either a private
asymmetric key (e.g., RSA) or a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC), allowing 
the receiver and/or any intermediate system to immediately or later
verify the integrity of the message. When signed with a private key 
it can also provide a measure of non-repudiation. The "Signature" scheme
can also be used by (typically) a client for authentication similar
to the purpose of the
<xref target="auth-scheme">'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme</xref>
  </t>
  <t>
The scheme
is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or
signing algorithm.  However, it does explicitly assume that senders can send an
HTTP `Date` header.
  </t>

  <section anchor="sig-header" title="Signature Header">

   <t>

The following sections assume that the "rsa-key-1" keyId provided by the
signer is an identifier meaningful to the server.
   </t>

   <section anchor="sig-rsa-example" title="RSA Example">

   <t>
The signature header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Signature: keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The client would compose the signing string as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
host: example.org\n
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n
content-length: 18</artwork>
    </figure>
Note that the '\n' symbols above are included to demonstrate where the new
line character should be inserted. There is no new line on the final line of
the signing string.
   </t>

   <t>
For an RSA-based signature, the authorization header and signature would then
be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Signature: keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sig-hmac-example" title="HMAC Example">

   <t>
For an HMAC-based signature without a list of headers specified, the
authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Signature: keyId="hmac-key-1",algorithm="hmac-sha256",
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(HMAC-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The only difference between the RSA Example and the HMAC Example is the
signature algorithm that is used. The client would compose the signing string
in the same way as the RSA Example above:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
host: example.org\n
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n

 <section anchor="appendix-a" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
There are a number of security considerations to take into account when implementing
or utilizing this specification. A thorough security analysis of this protocol,
including its strengths and weaknesses, can be found in
<eref target="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signatures-audit/">
Security Considerations for HTTP Signatures</eref>.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="appendix-b" title="Extensions">
  <t>
This specification was designed to be simple, modular, and extensible. There
are a number of other specifications that build on this one. For
example, the
<eref target="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signature-nonces/">HTTP Signature Nonces</eref>
specification details how to
use HTTP Signatures over a non-secured channel like HTTP and the
<eref target="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signature-trailers/">HTTP Signature Trailers</eref>
specification explains how to apply HTTP
Signatures to streaming content. Developers that desire more functionality
than this specification provides are urged to ensure that an extension
specification doesn't already exist before implementing a proprietary
extension.
  </t>

  <t>
If extensions to this specification are made by adding new Signature
Parameters, those extension parameters MUST be registered in the
Signature Authentication Scheme Registry. The registry will be created and
maintained at (the suggested URI)
<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-auth-scheme-signature">
http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-auth-scheme-signature</eref>. An
example entry in this registry is included below:

   <figure>
    <artwork>
Signature Parameter: nonce
Reference to specification: [HTTP_AUTH_SIGNATURE_NONCE], Section XYZ.
Notes (optional): The HTTP Signature Nonces specification details
how to use HTTP Signatures over a unsecured channel like HTTP.

IMPORTANT:
Older versions of this specification assumed the creation of a signature
algorithm registry. The specification of signature algorithms via the
`algorithm` property are expected to be deprecated in the near future
due to security concerns. As such, this entire section only remains for
historical purposes and is expected to be removed from the specification
in its entirety before the finalization of this document.
   </t>
   <t>
The following initial entries should be added to the Signature Algorithm
Registry to be created and maintained at (the suggested URI)
<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/signature-algorithms">
http://www.iana.org/assignments/signature-algorithms</eref>:
   </t>
   <t>
Editor's note: The references in this section are problematic as many of the
specifications that they refer to are too implementation specific, rather
than just pointing to the proper signature and hashing specifications. A
better approach might be just specifying the signature and hashing function
specifications, leaving implementers to connect the dots (which are not that
hard to connect).
