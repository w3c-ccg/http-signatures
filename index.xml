  <t>
When communicating over the Internet using the HTTP protocol, it can be
desirable for a server or client to authenticate the sender of a
particular message. It can also be desirable to ensure that the message
was not tampered with during transit. This document describes a way for
servers and clients to simultaneously add authentication and
message integrity to HTTP messages by using a digital signature.

 <note title="Feedback">
  <t>
This version (draft-cavage-http-signatures-11) is experimental and implementers
should be aware that a number of new features have been introduced in
this version that change previous algorithms in subtle but important ways.
The new features are designed to be fully backwards compatible. Older features
have been deprecated, but are still supported in the algorithms described by
this specification. There are no plans to remove deprecated features from
the specification to ensure backwards compatability for implementations dating
back to 2013.

 <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>
This protocol extension is intended to provide a simple and standard way for
clients to sign HTTP messages.
  </t>

  <t>
<xref target="RFC2617">HTTP Authentication</xref> defines Basic and Digest
authentication mechanisms, <xref target="RFC5246">TLS 1.2</xref>
defines cryptographically strong transport layer security, and
<xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> provides a
fully-specified alternative for authorization of web service requests. Each of
these approaches are employed on the Internet today with varying degrees of
protection. However, none of these schemes are designed to cryptographically
sign the HTTP messages themselves, which is required in order to ensure
end-to-end message integrity. An added benefit of signing the HTTP message
for the purposes of end-to-end message integrity is that the client can be
authenticated using the same mechanism without the need for multiple
round-trips.
  </t>

  <t>
Several web service providers have invented their own schemes for signing
HTTP messages, but to date, none have been standardized. While there
are no techniques in this proposal that are novel beyond the previous art, it
is useful to standardize a simple and cryptographically strong mechanism for
digitally signing HTTP messages.
  </t>
  <t>
This specification presents two mechanisms with distinct purposes:
    <list style="numbers">
       <t>
The "Signature" scheme which is intended primarily to allow a sender
to assert the contents of the message sent are correct and have not been
altered during transmission or storage in a way that alters the meaning expressed
in the original message as signed. Any party reading the message (the verifier)
may independently confirm the validity of the message signature. This scheme
is agnostic to the client/server direction and can be used to verify the contents of
either HTTP requests, HTTP reponses, or both.
       </t>
       <t>
The "Authorization" scheme which is intended primarily to allow a sender
to request access to a resource or resources by proving their identity. This
specification allows for this both with a shared secret (using HMAC) or with
public/private keys. The "Authorization" scheme is
typically used in authentication processes and not directly for message signing.
As a consequence `Authorization` header is normally generated
(and the message signed) by the HTTP client and the message verified by
the HTTP server.
       </t>
     </list>
  </t>

  <section anchor="intro-requests" title="Using Signatures in HTTP Requests">
   <t>
It is common practice to protect sensitive website and API functionality via
authentication mechanisms. Often, the entity accessing these APIs is a
piece of automated software outside of an interactive human session. While
there are mechanisms like OAuth and API secrets that are used to grant
API access, each have their weaknesses such as unnecessary complexity
for particular use cases or the use of shared secrets which may not be
acceptable to an implementer. Shared secrets also prohibit any possibility
for non-repudiation, while secure transports such as TLS do not provide
for this at all.
   </t>
   <t>
Digital signatures are widely used to provide authentication and integrity
assurances without
the need for shared secrets. They also do not require a round-trip in
order to authenticate the client, and allow the integrity of a message to
be verified independently of the transport (e.g. TLS).
A server need only have an understanding of the key (e.g. through
a mapping between
the key being used to sign the content and the authorized entity) to
verify that a message was signed by that entity.
   </t>
   <t>
When optionally combined with asymmetric keys associated with an
identity, this specification can also enable authentication of a client and
server with or without prior knowledge of each other.
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="intro-responses" title="Using Signatures in HTTP Responses">
   <t>
HTTP messages are routinely altered as they traverse the infrastrcture of the
Internet, for mostly benign reasons. Gateways and proxies add, remove and
alter headers for operational reasons, so a sender cannot rely on the
recipient receiving exactly the message transmitted.
By allowing a sender to sign specified headers, and recipient or
intermediate system can confirm that the original intent of the sender
is preserved, and including a Digest header can also verify the message
body is not modified. This allows any recipient to easily confirm both
the sender's identity, and any incidental or malicious changes that alter
the content or meaning of the message. 
   </t>
  </section>

 </section>

 <section anchor="components" title="The Components of a Signature">
  <t>
There are a number of components in a signature that are common between the
'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme and the 'Signature' HTTP Header. This
section details the components of the digital signature paremeters common to
both schemes.
  </t>

   <section anchor="params" title="Signature Parameters">

    <t>
The following section details the signature parameters.
    </t>

    <section anchor="keyId" title="keyId">
     <t>
REQUIRED. The `keyId` field is an opaque string that the server can use to look
up the component they need to validate the signature. It could be an SSH key
fingerprint, a URL to machine-readable key data, an LDAP DN, etc. Management
of keys and assignment of `keyId` is out of scope for this document.
Implementations MUST be able to discover metadata about the key from the
`keyId` such that they can determine the type of digital signature algorithm to
employ when creating or verifying signatures.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="signature" title="signature">
     <t>
REQUIRED.  The `signature` parameter is a base 64 encoded digital signature,
as described in <xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>,
<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4">Section 4</eref>.
The client uses the `algorithm` and `headers` signature parameters to form a
canonicalized `signing string`.  This `signing string` is then signed with the
key associated with `keyId` and the algorithm corresponding to `algorithm`.
The `signature` parameter is then set to the base 64 encoding of the signature.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="algorithm" title="algorithm">

     <t>
RECOMMENDED. The `algorithm` parameter is used to specify the signature
string construction mechanism. Valid values for this parameter can be found in
the <eref target="#hsa-registry">HTTP Signatures Algorithms Registry</eref> and
MUST NOT be marked "deprecated". Implementers SHOULD derive the digital
signature algorithm used by an implementation from the key metadata identified
by the `keyId` rather than from this field. If `algorithm` is provided and
differs from the key metadata identified by the `keyId`, for example
`rsa-sha256` but an EdDSA key is identified via `keyId`, then an implementation
MUST produce an error. Implementers should note that previous versions of the
`algorithm` parameter did not use the key information to derive the digital
signature type and thus could be utilized by attackers to expose security
vulnerabilities.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="created" title="created">
     <t>
RECOMMENDED.  The `created` field expresses when the signature was created.
The value MUST be a Unix timestamp integer value. A signature with a `created`
timestamp value that is in the future MUST NOT be processed. Using a Unix
timestamp simplifies processing and avoids timezone management required by
specifications such as RFC3339. Subsecond precision is not supported. This
value is useful when clients are not capable of controlling the `Date` HTTP
Header such as when operating in certain web browser environments.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="expires" title="expires">
     <t>
OPTIONAL.  The `expires` field expresses when the signature ceases to be valid.
The value MUST be a Unix timestamp integer value. A signatures with a
`expires` timestamp value that is in the past MUST NOT be processed. Using
a Unix timestamp simplifies processing and avoid timezone management existing
in RFC3339. Subsecod precision is allowed using decimal notation.
     </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="headers" title="headers">

     <t>
OPTIONAL.  The `headers` parameter is used to specify the list of HTTP headers
included when generating the signature for the message.  If specified, it
SHOULD be a lowercased, quoted list of HTTP header fields, separated by a
single space character. If not specified, implementations MUST operate as if
the field were specified with a single value, `(created)`, in the list
of HTTP headers. Note:
        <list style="numbers">
           <t>The list order is important, and MUST be specified in
the order the HTTP header field-value pairs are concatenated together
during <xref target="canonicalization">Signature String Construction</xref>
used during signing and verifying.
           </t>
           <t>
A `headers` parameter value without any headers MAY be provided,
but since it results in a signature of an empty string it is of almost no
utility and SHOULD NOT be used. This is distinct from not specifying
a `headers` parameter at all.
           </t>
        </list>
     </t>
    </section>

   </section>

   <section anchor="ambiguity" title="Ambiguous Parameters">
    <t>
If any of the parameters listed above are erroneously duplicated in the
associated header field, then the last parameter defined MUST be used. Any
parameter that is not recognized as a parameter, or is not well-formed,
MUST be ignored.
    </t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="canonicalization" title="Signature String Construction">

   <t>
A signed HTTP message needs to be tolerant of some trivial
alterations during transmission
as it goes through gateways, proxies, and other entities. These changes are often
of little consequence and very benign, but also often not visible to or
detectable by either the sender or the recipient. Simply signing the entire
message that was transmitted by the sender is therefore not feasible:
Even very minor changes would result in a signature which cannot be verified.
   </t>
   <t>
This specification allows the sender to select which headers are meaningful
by including their names in the `headers` signature parameter. The headers
appearing in this parameter are then used to construct the intermediate
Signature String, which is the data that is actually signed.
   </t>
   <t>
In order to generate the string that is signed with a key, the client MUST use
the values of each HTTP header field in the `headers` Signature parameter,
in the order they appear in the `headers` Signature parameter. It is out of
scope for this document to dictate what header fields
an application will want to enforce, but implementers SHOULD at minimum
include the (request-target) and (created) header fields.
   </t>
   <t>
To include the HTTP request target in the signature calculation, use the
special `(request-target)` header field name. To include the signature
creation time, use the special `(created)` header field name. To include
the signature expiration time, use the special `(expires)` header field name.
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
If the header field name is `(request-target)` then generate the header field
value by concatenating the lowercased :method, an ASCII space, and
the :path pseudo-headers (as specified in
<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3">HTTP/2, Section 8.1.2.3</eref>).
Note: For the avoidance of doubt, lowercasing only applies to the :method
pseudo-header and not to the :path pseudo-header.
     </t>
     <t>
If the header field name is `(created)` and the `algorithm`
parameter starts with `rsa`, `hmac`, or `ecdsa` an implementation MUST
produce an error. If the `created` Signature parameter is not specified, or
is not an integer, an implementation MUST produce an error. Otherwise, the
header field value is the integer expressed by the `created` signature
parameter.
     </t>
     <t>
If the header field name is `(expires)` and the `algorithm`
parameter starts with `rsa`, `hmac`, or `ecdsa` an implementation MUST
produce an error. If the `expires` Signature parameter is not specified, or
is not an integer, an implementation MUST produce an error. Otherwise, the
header field value is the integer expressed by the `created` signature
parameter.
     </t>
     <t>
Create the header field string by concatenating the lowercased header field
name followed with an ASCII colon `:`, an ASCII space ` `, and the header
field value. Leading and trailing optional whitespace (OWS) in the header field
value MUST be omitted (as specified in
<xref target="RFC7230">RFC7230</xref>,
<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.4">Section 3.2.4</eref>).
       <list style="numbers">
         <t>
If there are multiple instances of the same header field, all header field
values associated with the header field MUST be concatenated, separated by a
ASCII comma and an ASCII space `, `, and used in the order in which
they will appear in the transmitted HTTP message.
         </t>
         <t>
If the header value (after removing leading and trailing whitespace)
is a zero-length string, the signature string line correlating with that header
will simply be the (lowercased) header name, an ASCII colon `:`,
and an ASCII space ` `.
         </t>
         <t>
Any other modification to
the header field value MUST NOT be made.
         </t>
         <t>
If a header specified in the headers parameter is malformed or cannot be matched
with a provided header in the message, the implementation MUST produce an error.
         </t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>
If value is not the last value then append an ASCII newline `\n`.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
To illustrate the rules specified above, assume a `headers` parameter list
with the value of `(request-target) (created) (expires) host date cache-control
x-emptyheader x-example` with the following HTTP request headers:

    <figure>
     <artwork>
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
X-Example: Example header
    with some whitespace.
X-EmptyHeader:
Cache-Control: max-age=60
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
For the HTTP request headers above, the corresponding signature string is:

    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): get /foo
(created): 1402170695
(expires): 1402170995
host: example.org
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
cache-control: max-age=60, must-revalidate
x-emptyheader:
x-example: Example header with some whitespace.
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="create" title="Creating a Signature">

   <t>
In order to create a signature, a client MUST:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
Use the `headers` and `algorithm` values as well as the contents of the HTTP
message, to create the signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
Use the key associated with `keyId` to generate a digital signature on the
signature string.
     </t>
     <t>
The `signature` is then generated by base 64 encoding the output of the
digital signature algorithm.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
For example, assume that the `algorithm` value is "hs2019" and the
`keyId` refers to an EdDSA public key. This would signal to the application
that the signature string construction mechanism is the one
defined in <eref target="#canonicalization">
  Section 2.3: Signature String Construction
</eref>,
the signature string hashing function is SHA-512, and the signing
algorithm is Ed25519 as defined in
<xref target="RFC8032">RFC 8032</xref>, Section 5.1: Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx,
and Ed25519. The result of the signature creation algorithm should result in a
binary string, which is then base 64 encoded and placed into the
`signature` value.
   </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="verify" title="Verifying a Signature">

   <t>
In order to verify a signature, a server MUST:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>
Use the received HTTP message, the `headers` value, and the
<xref target="canonicalization">Signature String Construction</xref>
algorithm to recreate the signature.
     </t>
     <t>
The `algorithm`, `keyId`, and base 64 decoded `signature` listed in the
signature parameters are then used to verify the authenticity of the
digital signature. Note: The application verifying the signature MUST derive
the digital signature algorithm from the metadata associated with the
`keyId` and MUST NOT use the value of `algorithm` from the signed message.
     </t>
    </list>
   </t>
   <t>
If a header specified in the `headers` value of the signature parameters
(or the default item `(created)` where the `headers` value is not supplied)
is absent from the message, the implementation MUST produce an error.
   </t>

   <t>
For example, assume that the `algorithm` value was "hs2019" and
and the `keyId` refers to an EdDSA public key. This would signal to the
application that the signature string construction mechanism is the one
defined in <eref target="#canonicalization">
  Section 2.3: Signature String Construction
</eref>,
the signature string hashing function is SHA-512, and the signing
algorithm is Ed25519 as defined in
<xref target="RFC8032">RFC 8032</xref>, Section 5.1: Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx,
and Ed25519.  The result of the signature verification algorithm should
result in a successful verification unless the headers protected by the
signature were tampered with in transit.
   </t>

  </section>
 </section>

 <section anchor="auth-scheme" title="The 'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme">

  <t>
The "Signature" authentication scheme is based on the model that the client must
authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by either a private
asymmetric key (e.g., RSA) or a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC).
  </t>
  <t>
The scheme
is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or
signing algorithm.
  </t>

  <section anchor="auth-header" title="Authorization Header">

   <t>
The client is expected to send an Authorization header
(as defined in
<xref target="RFC7235">RFC 7235</xref>, <eref
target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-2.1">
Section 4.1</eref>) where the "auth-scheme" is "Signature" and the
"auth-param" parameters meet the requirements listed in
Section 2: The Components of a Signature.
   </t>

   <t>
The rest of this section uses the following HTTP request as an example.

    <figure>
     <artwork>
POST /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
Content-Length: 18

{"hello": "world"}
     </artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
Note that the use of the `Digest` header field is per
<xref target="RFC3230">RFC 3230</xref>, <eref
target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3230#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</eref>
and is included merely as a demonstration of how an implementer could include
information about the body of the message in the signature.
The following sections also assume that the "rsa-key-1" keyId asserted by the
client is an identifier meaningful to the server.
   </t>

   <section anchor="auth-isa" title="Initiating Signature Authorization">

    <t>
A server may notify a client when a resource is protected by requiring a signature.
To initiate this process, the server
will request that the client authenticate itself via a
<eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1">401 response
</eref> code. The
server may optionally specify which HTTP headers it expects to be signed
by specifying the `headers` parameter in the WWW-Authenticate header.
For example:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Thu, 08 Jun 2014 18:32:30 GMT
Content-Length: 1234
Content-Type: text/html
WWW-Authenticate: Signature realm="Example",headers="(request-target) (created)"

...
</artwork>
    </figure>
    </t>
   </section>

   <section anchor="auth-rsa-example" title="RSA Example">

   <t>
The authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="hs2019",
headers="(request-target) (created) host digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA512(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The client would compose the signing string as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
(created): 1402174295
host: example.org\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n
content-length: 18</artwork>
    </figure>
Note that the '\n' symbols above are included to demonstrate where the new
line character should be inserted. There is no new line on the final line of
the signing string. Each HTTP header above is displayed on a new line to provide
better readability of the example.
   </t>

   <t>
For an RSA-based signature, the authorization header and signature would then
be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="hs2019",
headers="(request-target) (created) host digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA512(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="auth-hmac-example" title="HMAC Example">

   <t>
For an HMAC-based signature without a list of headers specified, the
authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Authorization: Signature keyId="hmac-key-1",algorithm="hs2019",
headers="(request-target) (created) host digest content-length",
signature="Base64(HMAC-SHA512(signing string))"
     </artwork>
    </figure>

The only difference between the RSA Example and the HMAC Example is the
digital signature algorithm that is used. The client would compose the
signing string in the same way as the RSA Example above:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
(created): 1402174295
host: example.org\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n

 <section anchor="sig" title="The 'Signature' HTTP Header">

  <t>
The "Signature" HTTP Header provides a mechanism to link the headers of a
message (client request or server response) to a digital signature. By
including the "Digest" header with a properly formatted digest,
the message body can also be linked to the signature. The
signature is generated and verified either using a shared secret (e.g. HMAC)
or public/private keys (e.g. RSA, EC). This allows the receiver and/or any
intermediate system to immediately or later verify the integrity of the
message. When the signature is generated with a private key it can also
provide a measure of non-repudiation, though a full implementation of a
non-repudiatable statement is beyond the scope of this specification and
highly dependent on implementation.
  </t>
  <t>
The "Signature" scheme can also be
used for authentication similar to the purpose of the
<xref target="auth-scheme">'Signature' HTTP Authentication Scheme</xref>.
The scheme
is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or
signing algorithm.
  </t>

  <section anchor="sig-header" title="Signature Header">

   <t>
The sender is expected to transmit a header
(as defined in
<xref target="RFC7230">RFC 7230</xref>, <eref
target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2">
Section 3.2</eref>) where the "field-name" is "Signature", and the "field-value"
contains one or more "auth-param"s (as defined in
<xref target="RFC7235">RFC 7235</xref>, <eref
target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-4.1">
Section 4.1</eref>) where the "auth-param" parameters meet the requirements
listed in Section 2: The Components of a Signature.
   </t>

   <t>
The rest of this section uses the following HTTP request as an example.

    <figure>
     <artwork>
POST /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
Content-Length: 18

{"hello": "world"}</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The following sections assume that the "rsa-key-1" keyId provided by the
signer is an identifier meaningful to the server.
   </t>

   <section anchor="sig-rsa-example" title="RSA Example">

   <t>
The signature header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Signature: keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="hs2019",
created=1402170695, expires=1402170995,
headers="(request-target) host date digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The client would compose the signing string as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n
(created): 1402170695
(expires): 1402170995
host: example.org\n
digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=\n
content-length: 18</artwork>
    </figure>
Note that the '\n' symbols above are included to demonstrate where the new
line character should be inserted. There is no new line on the final line of
the signing string. Each HTTP header above is displayed on a new line to provide
better readability of the example.
   </t>

   <t>
For an RSA-based signature, the authorization header and signature would then
be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Signature: keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="hs2019",
date=1402170695, expires=1402170995,
headers="(request-target) (created) (expires) host digest content-length",
signature="Base64(RSA-SHA512(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sig-hmac-example" title="HMAC Example">

   <t>
For an HMAC-based signature without a list of headers specified, the
authorization header and signature would be generated as:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
Signature: keyId="hmac-key-1",algorithm="hs2019",
date=1402170695, expires=1402170995,
headers="(request-target) (created) (expires) host digest content-length",
signature="Base64(HMAC-SHA512(signing string))"</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>

   <t>
The only difference between the RSA Example and the HMAC Example is the
signature algorithm that is used. The client would compose the signing string
in the same way as the RSA Example above:
    <figure>
     <artwork>
(request-target): post /foo\n

 <section anchor="appendix-a" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
There are a number of security considerations to take into account when implementing
or utilizing this specification. A thorough security analysis of this protocol,
including its strengths and weaknesses, can be found in
<eref target="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signatures-audit/">
Security Considerations for HTTP Signatures</eref>.
  </t>
 </section>

 <section anchor="appendix-b" title="Extensions">
  <t>
This specification was designed to be simple, modular, and extensible. There
are a number of other specifications that build on this one. For
example, the
<eref target="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signature-nonces/">HTTP Signature Nonces</eref>
specification details how to
use HTTP Signatures over a non-secured channel like HTTP and the
<eref target="https://web-payments.org/specs/source/http-signature-trailers/">HTTP Signature Trailers</eref>
specification explains how to apply HTTP
Signatures to streaming content. Developers that desire more functionality
than this specification provides are urged to ensure that an extension
specification doesn't already exist before implementing a proprietary
extension.
  </t>

  <t>
If extensions to this specification are made by adding new Signature
Parameters, those extension parameters MUST be registered in the
Signature Authentication Scheme Registry. The registry will be created and
maintained at (the suggested URI)
<eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-auth-scheme-signature">
https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-auth-scheme-signature</eref>. An
example entry in this registry is included below:

   <figure>

better approach might be just specifying the signature and hashing function
